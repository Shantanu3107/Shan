## Matrix Operations


## Introduction
Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Everyday we will be involving with various types of calculations around us. Matrices is a mathematical entity where numbers are arranged in rows and columns. A lot of applications exist with matrices in real life.

## Benefits
A user who is working on a laptop or a desktop who would be working on matrix based calculations, can make use of this application as handy. A human being can find the output values of a matrix for a maximum of size 3 X 3, i.e 3 rows and 3 columns. If they try to solve the matrix for dimensions above 3 , the time consumed is large and verification that the solution is correct or not consumes extra time. Hence this tool can be used to cross check the matrix operations conducted.

## Cost
The cost for implementing a project involving matrix calculations is minimal to none. 

## Defining our system
The system on the whole is viewed as a blackbox which accepts input of a single number. Then the mapping of the number is done so as to perform the appropriate function. Then the user will be prompted to enter the matrix size. After that the user is prompted to enter the matrix elements. The input is stored in 2D arrays which are dynamically allocated and passed to the respective functions. Then the output is printed on the screen. This whole process is in a loop until the user presses a key which will exit the program.

## SWOT Analysis
